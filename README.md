# Machine-Vision-hand_gesture_control- and count the fingers


Hand Gesture Control using OpenCV and cvzone.
This repository contains a Python script that enables hand gesture control using the OpenCV and cvzone libraries. With this script, you can control your mouse cursor and perform clicks using hand gestures.

**Installation**:

To use this script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3,
OpenCV,
cvzone,
pyautogui,

**Usage**:

To run the script, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Connect a webcam to your computer.

Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.


The script will access your webcam and display the video feed.
Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to control the mouse cursor

**If you raise your index finger and lower your middle finger, the cursor will move to the right.**

**FINGER COUNTER:**

**This project utilizes computer vision techniques to count the number of fingers shown in front of a webcam. By tracking hand landmarks, the program detects the open or closed state of each finger and provides a real-time count.**

**Features:**

1.Use the webcam to capture video frames

2.Detect hand landmarks using the Mediapipe library

3.Determine the open or closed state of each finger

4.Calculate and displays the number of fingers

5.Provide a visual representation of the finger count on the video frame


**Prerequisites:**

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
Mediapipe library
Webcam connected to the computer

**Usage:**

-Install the required libraries by running pip install opencv-python mediapipe.
-Connect a webcam to your computer.
-Run the script main.py.
-Position your hand in front of the webcam.
-Observe the finger count displayed on the video frame.
